# Internet Programming - Website Quiz
Created a quiz website, "Do You Know Your Memes". Includes four sets of pages for the front-end aspect and two sets of tables for the back-end aspect. On the front-end, we made two PHP pages called Quiz.php and Results.php. We also created two CSS pages, Quiz.css and Results.css, to connect with their PHP pages.
